Sloth
=====

Sloth is a Ruby gem that implements the `lazy()` function as robustly as
possible.

	obj = lazy{ p(:lazily_evaluated) }

Sloths can only (easily) be distinguished from non-sloths by the sloth? method.

	lazy{:sloth}.sloth? # => true
	lazy{:sloth}.class  # => Symbol
	:sloth.sloth?       # => false
